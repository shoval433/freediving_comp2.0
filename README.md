# freediving_comp

This application is designed for freediving competitions and allows competitors to register for various events. 
Each competition has a unique database, and the application provides competitors with an updated list of participants. The application is built using Python Flask and utilizes MongoDB and Nginx for static files and reverse-proxying. All components are connected using Docker Compose.


## ðŸ¦‘ About Me
My name is Shoval and i am DevOps Engineer focuses on deploying, automating, and maintaining cloud-based and on-premise infrastructure. I have a diverse skillset, having worked with a wide range of technologies, including AWS, Azure, Terraform, Jenkins,Artifactory, Git, Docker, Nginx, Python, Bash, and SQL.

In my most recent project, I was developing and implementing CI/CD workflows in Jenkins for multiple applications, working with Jfrog's Artifactory to manage artifacts, and building Python applications in a microservices architecture for deployment on AWS. My experience with virtual machines and different databases and web frameworks makes me a well-rounded engineer who can handle a variety of tasks.
